# Futai RGB encoder, 12 WS2811 F5 LED ring on a white blinde plate
The ultimate DIY human light controller interface plenty of colored LEDs.

## Credits
Inspired by [isotope-engineering's RGB rotary encoder](https://github.com/isotope-engineering/RGB-Encoder-Board "isotope-engineering's RGB rotary encoder").

Shoutout to [ezcGman](https://github.com/ezcGman "ezcGman") for the assistance with the KiCad symbols and footprints, hints about thermal reliefs on pads and continous feedback about his experiences while concretizing the board.

## KiCad dependencies
This project uses custom KiCad symbols and footprints and 3D models. Follow folder 'libs' with all details.

## Parts list
The folder 'gerber-and-bom' contains the zipped production files for pcb ordering and intercative bill of material ibom.html with purchase links for the components.

Additional to this you can purchase 10 blind plates also on [aliexpress.com](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32884601740.html "aliexpress.com")

## Schematic
Dive deeper into technics in the folder 'datasheets-and-schematic'.

## Tools list
### Required
- A soldering iron
- Solder

### Optional
- For SMD components:
  - A hot air soldering/reflow station. However, the smallest parts are 0805 SMD components which can be soldered with a soldering iron. The LED's' legs are very close together and easier to solder with hot air.
  - Solder paste
  - Tweezers
  - the famous IKEA cork coaster (Onderzetter) that gently takes up the heat of your soldering tools
